# Face-GAN

## Description
A fun project just to get myself acquainted with Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). The main aim of this project was to map random noise in latent space to create different human faces.

## Knowledge Gained
1. Difference between Generator and Discrimantor networks and how they work.
2. Working of DCGAN and its architecture.
3. Training GANs is different from other Convolution Models. Here, discriminator and generator must be equally good.

## Result
Due to computation and time boundation, I stopped training the model once I could distinguish a face from random noise.

## To-Do
1. Train longer and tune further to get better results.
2. Control the output of GANs. For example, the hair color, eye color or masculanity of the face.
